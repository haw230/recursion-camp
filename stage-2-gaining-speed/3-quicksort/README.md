# Quicksort
Quicksort is the most modern, most used sorting algorithm. It divides and conquers but different way than merge sort. Quick sort picks a pivot (any element), shifts the list (partitioning) until the left is less and the right is greater than or equal to the pivot. The left side is sorted and then a new pivot is chosen and repeated until the entire list is done.
