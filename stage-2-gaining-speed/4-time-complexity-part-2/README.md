# Time Complexity Part 2

## O(log n)
With logarithms, the result will be ten to the power of a *certain number* will be ```n``` and the time taken will be that *certain number*. [Here](https://youtu.be/Z5myJ8dg_rM) is a Khan Academy lesson on logs. So, binary search reached that speed easy with its divide and conquer strategy. However, our sorting algorithms can't be as efficent. Why? We have to still check the ordering somehow and be able to switch the elements meaning that the steps can never be less than ```n```.
