# How to use Anadromi
Anadromi is powered by GitHub, which hosts the lessons, and C9, which is an online IDE. They are vital for coding tasks, which is the heart of Anadromi. Both GitHub and C9 are online, featuring a uniform experience for everyone undertaking the curriculum. Here's how to use it:
### Step 1: Make a GitHub Account

GitHub will be important for hosting code.

### Step 2: Log into C9 with GitHub
![C9](https://github.com/haw230/the-anadromi-project/blob/pictures/intro/step2.png)
In the top right corner, there's the cat icon. Click that and log in with the GitHub account you previously made.

### Step 3: Return to GitHub and complete a lesson

When you've finished a lesson, there will be a coding task waiting for you. The link will take you to a separate repository, where the challenge awaits you.

### Step 4: Fork the Coding Task Repo
![Fork](https://github.com/haw230/the-anadromi-project/blob/pictures/intro/step4.png)
Click "fork" on the top right corner. This creates a fork on your account of the repository, so you can edit it however you like.

### Step 5: Clone It
![Clone](https://github.com/haw230/the-anadromi-project/blob/pictures/intro/step5.png)
Click the green "Clone or download" button and then click "Use SSH". It should read "git@github.com:username/project-name". Keep it copied, we'll need it later.

### Step 6: Open a Workspace
![Open](https://github.com/haw230/the-anadromi-project/blob/pictures/intro/step6_1.png)
Go to C9 and open up a new workspace.
