## Friday July 21
Started working on actual lessons. Will figure out tests later. Finished 

## Monday July 24
Weird error bugged me all morning with pytest. Apparently test function names must be start with ```test_``` such as 
``` python
def test_simple():
    assert(1) = 1
```
Otherwise pytest won't work. Understood makefiles better today. --verbose and --disable-pytest-warnings are useful. There are other flags too. Got tests to continue after failure. Unfortunately, they don't provide enough information. Will have to look for another way. Wrote a rough intro to GitHub and C9. Gotta come back and add screenshots.

## Tuesday July 25
Wrote my own test. Works great, tested multiple times. Going to implement it for each lesson. Template is complete so the rest should be smooth sailing. Selection sort almost finished. Gonna have to work on some at home or bring my laptop (not sure how to screenshot on these computers). Goal for tomorrow and day after is to finish stages 1 and 2.

## Wednesday July 26
Finished a good chunk of bubble sort and time complexity. Changed some things on the curriculum. Added gifs for visualization using pylab created by glowing python. For tomorrow, finish up stage 1 and hopefully finish stage 2 as well. If not, will have to do some extra work at home.

## Thursday July 27
Finished remainder of bubble sort and time complexity. Worked on binary search. Fixed bugs.

## Monday July 31
Started on supplementary lesson to ease transition (added binary "check"). Was almost done when GitHub service crashed, lasted an hour (10:30 - 11:30). Instead worked on visualizing bubble sort and selection sort run time. Turned out pretty nice. Added more to binary search, made solution for merge sort.

## Tuesday August 1
Finished some lessons. Quicksort is slower than other sorts (???). Graphed linear and binary. Finish binary search.

## Wednesday August 2
