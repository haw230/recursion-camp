# Stage 1: Hill Climbing
Welcome to the first stage of The Anadromi Project. Here you will get your feet wet by learning three different algorithms and implementing each with your own code. If you don't have any experience with either GitHub or Cloud9, go [here](https://github.com/haw230/the-anadromi-project/tree/master/introduction) for a short tutorial on how to complete the coding tasks.

Each lesson will have 7 sections, each playing a vital role to your learning. These consist of:
### 1. Introduction
The introduction will explain the problem and what uses the algorithm has in daily life. Some are less applicable than others but keep in mind that we're to practice programming skills too!

### 2. Theory
The theory section explains in detail how the algorithm will operate.

### 3. PseudoCode
The pseudocode builds on the theory section, puting the steps into a fake language.

### 4. Analysis
The analysis takes a more abstract look at the algorithm, dissecting its efficency and operation.

### 5. Extra Resources
Extra resources are provided that explains the material in different ways or offers additional support.

### 6. Coding Task
Here, you will implement a Python version of the algorithm. In the repository, there will be test cases to check your program and a solution explained in detail in case you get stuck.

### 7. Key Words
Key words will include, well, key words. Terms that are important and occasionally difficult to understand are isolated in this section. Each use of a key word will include a link down to its location in the key words section.
